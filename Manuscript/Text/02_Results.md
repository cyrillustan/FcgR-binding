## IgG-FcγR binding varies with affinity and avidity

![**FcγR binding changes with FcγR-IgG pair and avidity.** A) Quantification of human IgG subclass TNP-4-BSA and TNP-26-BSA immune complex binding to CHO cells expressing the indicated human FcγRs (N = 4). Background binding of the immune complexes to CHO cells expressing no human FcγR was subtracted from the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) obtained for binding to CHO cells expressing individual human FcγRs. B) Receptor expression quantification for each CHO cell line expressing individual FcγRs. C) Measured TNP-4-BSA immune complex binding, normalized to the receptor expression within each CHO cell line, as a function of the measured FcγR-IgG subclass affinity [@Bruhns:2009kg]. D) Measured TNP-26-BSA immune complex binding, normalized to the receptor expression within each CHO cell line, as a function of the measured FcγR-IgG subclass affinity [@Bruhns:2009kg].](./Figures/Figure1.png){#fig:Binding}

Building upon earlier work, we wished to examine the influence of immune complex avidity and composition on binding and activation of different FcγRs [@Lux:2013iv].

The measured binding closely recapitulated that measured previously [@Lux:2013iv]. Receptor expression measurement revealed **X-fold** variation in the amount of each FcγR expressed [@fig:Binding]. To interpret these measurements, we normalized the amount of binding measured to the amount of FcγR expressed, and plotted each measurement with respect to the measured affinity of the individual FcγR-IgG monovalent interaction.
