# Discussion

A unified model for the coordinate contributions of IC avidity and affinity provides a framework for reasoning about the effects of changing antibody-antigen binding or constant region composition ([@Fig:Fit]). Glycosylation forms and engineered mutants, in addition to variation in antigen binding, exponentially expand the repertoire of antibody variants possible. The quantitative model presented here provides a robust framework for reasoning about the contributions each of these variables. Since it would not be feasible to explore all combinations of these variables, such a model is necessary for knowing which combination of variables would result in the most effective immunotherapeutic intervention. Further, a unified model for IC engagement makes it possible to consider the effects of antibody combinations in a rational manner.

In addition to enabling the intelligent design of immunotherapeutic interventions, a model of IC engagement makes it feasible to infer the factors contributing to the *in vivo* efficacy of immunotherapies ([@Fig:InVivoResults]). In particular, we show that such a model can predict the effect of tumor-targeted antibodies better than affinity for each FcÎ³R alone. While we lack information about the effective avidity for TA99 engagement, more detailed characterization of antigen binding might enable coordinate rational design of antibody class and antigen avidity. This approach has broad applicability to many diseases in which effector function plays a key role, including the design of therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of infectious disease, autoimmune disorders, and other cancers.

More generally, these results demonstrate the ability of molecular models linked to data-driven inference to deconvolve *in vivo* function. Due to the baffling complexity of immune system, model-driven design is vital to the advancement of immunotherapeutic design. Like Fc receptors, many innate immune receptors are extensively characterized in their interactions and knockout effects, and yet operate through combinatorial complexity introduced by sets of protein species. With this "parts list" of immune system components, model-driven design will be an essential component of immune engineering.
