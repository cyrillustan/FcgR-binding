# Methods

## Immune complex binding measurement

Immune complex binding to human FcγRs was analyzed using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells stably expressing human FcγRs as previously described [@Lux:2013iv]. **Need to add how receptor expression was quantified.**

Human anti–2-,4-,6-trinitrophenyl (TNP) variable regions were cloned from cDNA libraries isolated from the 7B4 hybridoma cell line (kindly provided by Birgitta Heyman, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden), fused to human IgG constant regions by PCR, and produced by transient transfection in HEK293T cells in protein-free medium, followed by purification from the supernatant via protein G, as described (23). Point mutations at position as- paragine 297 (N297A) and aspartate 265 (D265A) were introduced using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

ICs were generated by coincubation of 10 mg/ml human anti-TNP IgG and 5 mg/ml TNP-coupled BSA for 3 h with gentle shaking at room temperature. The relative size of TNP-4–BSA and TNP-26–BSA ICs was analyzed by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. Briefly, ICs were mixed with PEG 6000 in PBS at a final concentration of 0–20% PEG 6000. After overnight incubation at 4℃, ICs were precipitated by centrifugation at 2000 3 g for 30 min at 4℃ and washed once with PEG 6000, followed by precipitation at 2000 3 g and resuspension by shaking in prewarmed PBS for 1 h at 37℃. ICs precipitating at the respective PEG concentrations were detected by ELISA using the Human IgG ELISA Quantitation Kit
(Bethyl Laboratories), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amount of IgG present in the different fractions was normalized to the input before PEG precipitation and is shown as arbitrary units.

ICs were incubated with 100,000 CHO cells stably expressing human FcgRs for 1 h under gentle shaking at 4℃. Bound ICs were detected by flow cytometry using a PE-conjugated goat anti-human IgG F(ab9)2 fragment at 0.5 mg/ml (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Data were analyzed with Flow Cytometry Analysis Software (FlowJo) or FACSDiva Software. Briefly, Abs were incubated with 50 U/mg IgG PNGase F or 1 mg endoglycosidase S (EndoS)/100 mg IgG overnight at 37℃. Complete deglycosylation was confirmed by PAGE under reducing conditions and subsequent staining with Coomassie brilliant blue or by lectin blotting, as previously described (26). IC binding to human peri- pheral blood leukocytes was blocked by preincubation of cells with anti- FcgRI (clone 10.1), anti-FcgRIIA/B (clone AT10; provided by M. Glennie, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K.), and anti-FcgRIII (clone 3G8) at 10 mg/ml. Data were analyzed with Flow Cytometry Analysis Software (FlowJo).

## Model

### Base model

The equilibrium binding of TNP-X-BSA to FcγRs was modeled using a two-parameter equilibrium model of multivalent ligand binding to monovalent receptors expressed uniformly on a cell surface [@Stone:2001fm] [@Perelson:1980fs]. Within the model, binding is assumed to occur first according to a monovalent binding interaction governed by the individual binding site affinity K~a~, and then through subsequent cross-linking events with equilibrium partitioning K~x~.

Therefore, according to the model, the number of ligand bound i-valently to the cell at equilibrium, v~eq~, can be found using the relation:

$$ v_{i,eq} = {v\choose i} (K_x)^{i-1} {L_0}{K_a} \left(R_{eq}\right)^i $$

Here, K~x~ is a cross-linking constant with units of # per cell, L~0~ is the concentration of ligand, and R~eq~ is the number of unbound receptors at equilibrium. Consequently,

$$ L_{bound} = \sum_{i=1}^{v} v_{i,eq} = \sum_{i=1}^{v} {v\choose i} (K_X)^{i-1} \frac{L_0}{K_D} (R_{eq})^i $$

where $L_{bound}$ is the total number of ligand bound at equilibrium and $v$ is the effective avidity of the ligand. It is important to distinguish between the effective avidity and the actual avidity of a multivalent ligand, as steric effects might prevent such a ligand from binding to $v_{actual}$ receptors at once. We will later show that this was the case in Lux's experiments. $R_{eq}$ is a function of $v$, $L_0$, $K_D$, $K_X$, and $Rtot$, the total number of receptors expressed on the cell surface, and can be approximated numerically using the following relationship when these parameters are known:

$$ R_{tot} = R_{eq} \Big(1+v \frac{L_0}{K_D} (1+K_X R_{eq})^{v-1}\Big) $$

Let $R_{eq}(R_{tot},v,L_0,K_D,K_X)$ be the numerical approximation of $R_{eq}$ given the parameters listed. Consequent of Equation (1), $R_{multi}$, the number of receptors that are clustered with at least one other receptor at equilibrium, can be found as follows:

$$ R_{multi} = \sum_{i=2}^{v} iv_{i,eq} $$


### Parameters and Assumptions

Association constants for all combinations of IgG and FcγR were obtained from previous experimental measurements [@Bruhns:2009kg]. In each replicate of Lux's assay, cells were coincubated with 5 µg/ml TNP-X-BSA. Because the molar masses of a 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl groups and of BSA are approximately 173 Da and 66430 Da, respectively, we represented the molar concentrations of TNP-4-BSA and TNP-26-BSA as 74 nM and 70 nM [@Lux:2013iv]. We also assumed that there were two, different conversion factors between the number of ICs bound and MFI for TNP-4-BSA and TNP-26-BSA. Lastly, we assumed that, due to steric effects, the effective avidities of TNP-4-BSA and (especially) TNP-26-BSA might be different that their actual avidities. This required us, in total, to fit 11 parameters: the total expression level $R_{tot}$ for each FcγR, $K_X$, conversion factors from ligand bound to MFI for both TNP-BSAs ($c_{4}$ and $c_{26}$, respectively), and effective avidities for both TNP-BSAs ($f_{4}$ and $f_{26}$, respectively).

### Specification for K~x~



Based on the order of magnitude of cross-linking constant values presented in the aforementioned paper by Stone et al., we assumed that our cross-linking constant $K_X$ should be between








### Model Fitting

We fit our model to binding measurements for each FcγR-IgG pair using Markov Chain Monte Carlo as implemented within the emcee package [@ForemanMackey:2013ux]. We assumed that the variance in each measurement was proportional to the true value. Therefore, we additionally fit a variance parameter σ~1~, and calculated the likelihood of each measurement given a model by comparison to a normal distribution with mean equal to the model prediction and standard deviation equal to the prediction times σ~1~.

In addition to the measured immune complex binding data, the receptor expression of each cell line was quantitatively measured. These measurements were treated similarly, with a separate variance parameter σ~2~, and likelihood calculated by comparison to a normal distribution with mean equal to the predicted receptor expression and standard deviation equal to that prediction times σ~2~. The overall likelihood of the model at each parameter set was calculated by summing each of these individual likelihoods. The priors for each parameter were therefore otherwise specified to be uniform.
