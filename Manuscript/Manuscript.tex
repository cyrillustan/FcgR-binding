\begin{abstract}
Most immune receptors must cluster in order to transduce signal across the membrane. This clustering is achieved by the binding of immune complexes to the cell surface. Models describing the binding of multivalent ligand presenting a single repeated epitope to monovalent receptors presenting a single paratope have been used to describe the binding of immune complexes to the surfaces of immune cells. One such model predicts that immune complexes can be designed such that, for any pair of receptors which bind to the aforementioned epitope with affinities of significantly different orders of magnitude, the number of receptors of the first kind that are clustered will be far greater than the number clustered of the other. We show here that in designing immune complexes that bind with the greatest disparity in number of ligand bound between two receptor kinds of non-negligible affinity, the most important parameters to consider are the avidity of the immune complex and its rates of cross-linking and breaking cross-links between receptors. We further show that most of these complexes fall under two structural motifs.
